Run fleecefinder.py to pull and categorize all FLEECE and happY words from the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary (cmu.json) into a new file fleecefinder_results.txt

More sets can be generated by calling the guess_lexical_sets function but much of the logic isn't implemented yet. But FLEECE and happY are fully functional.

Worth noting that the dictionary is only for North American English, but this doesn't matter for FLEECE and happY. The full version of this tool will compare against a UK dictionary as well.
